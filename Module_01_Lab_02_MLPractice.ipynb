        " **Positive Effects:**  When you increase the percentage of data in the validation set, you typically have a smaller training set. This can be beneficial in the following ways: Better Model Evaluation: With a larger validation set, you can more accurately assess how well your model generalizes to unseen data. This can lead to a more reliable estimate of your model's performance. Reduced Overfitting: A smaller training set may help prevent overfitting since the model has less data to memorize, making it more likely to learn meaningful patterns.\n",

        "**Imagine Flipping a Coin:** If you flip a coin just once, you might get heads or tails, but you can't be sure if it's biased or fair based on just one flip. But if you flip it many times and calculate the average, you get a more accurate idea of the coin's fairness.\n",

        "**Similarly with Data Splits:** When you split your data into training and validation sets, there might be some randomness involved. Averaging the validation accuracy over multiple splits smooths out this randomness. It helps you get a more stable and trustworthy estimate of how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data.\n",

        "**Single Split:** If you just use one random split between training and validation data, your model's performance on the validation set might be influenced by luck. It's like taking one test and getting a good or bad score due to chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multiple Splits:** When you average validation accuracy over multiple different splits, you're considering how your model performs in different scenarios. It's like taking the test several times under different conditions. Averaging these results gives you a more reliable estimate of how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data, which is like a final test.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, yes, averaging over multiple splits helps provide a more accurate estimate of how your model will likely do on the real test (the test set). It reduces the impact of luck or randomness in a single split."
